# react_with_sass

This repository was created with create-react-app and then extended to use `.scss` files that load modules with the `@use` command (instead of `@import` which is deprecated).

If you want to build this project by hand, see my [Howto: How to enable SASS in a create-react-app site](https://github.com/edwardtanguay/react_with_sass).
